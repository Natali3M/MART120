    <body>
        Jamie was a curious little girl.
        <p> </p>
        She wondered what people saw when they were colorblind.
        <p> </p>
        Blue? Green? Red?
        <p> </p>
        Would they know the difference?
        <p> </p>
        Jamie pondered this under the shade of a large oak tree in the warm sunny day.
        <p> </p>
        Jamie got up and ran out of the park to her house.
        <p> </p>
        Jamie ran to her secret lair (hidden in the shed).
        <p> </p>
        She deviced a special pair of glasses. 
        <p> </p>
        They would only allow her to see certain colors. 
        <p> </p>
        Blue in one eye. Green, purple, and orange in the other eye.
        <p> </p>
        Jamie left her lair with the special spectacles. 
        <p> </p>
        The world looked extrodinary.
        <p> </p>
        -Next summer-
        <p> </p>
        Jamie and her parents traveled to Africa!
        <p> </p>
        She was so excited and brought her glass to experience the world.
        <p> </p>
        She saw two Zebras hugging and decided to draw what she saw.
